        <h2>Understanding AR & VR</h2>
        <p><strong>Augmented Reality (AR)</strong> overlays digital elements (text, images, 3D objects) onto the real world. It enhances real-world environments by integrating virtual components, visible through devices like smartphones, tablets, and AR headsets.</p>
        <p><strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong> creates a completely immersive digital experience where users can interact with a fully simulated environment using VR headsets like the Meta Quest.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of AR</h2>
        <h3>Marker-Based AR</h3>
        <p>Marker-based AR requires a predefined visual marker, such as a QR code or a printed image, to trigger digital content. The camera scans the marker and overlays virtual objects onto it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used in educational tools, books, and toys to enhance learning experiences.</li>
            <li>Examples: Wall decals, toys, tattoos, encyclopedia books, action flashcards (e.g., HoloKitab from Shark Tank India), storybooks, and mobile skins.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Markerless AR</h3>
        <p>Markerless AR does not require predefined markers. Instead, it uses technologies like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to understand the environment and place virtual objects dynamically.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Used in applications that require real-time interaction with surroundings.</li>
            <li>Examples: Pokémon GO, real-life space overlays, and superimposed holograms.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Ways to Experience AR</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web-Based AR:</strong> AR experiences accessible directly via web browsers without requiring app installations.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> AR applications developed for Android and iOS, such as the IKEA Place app, which allows users to visualize furniture in their home.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Media AR:</strong> Platforms enabling users to create and use AR effects, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SPARK AR (Meta):</strong> Used for creating AR filters on Instagram and Facebook.</li>
                    <li><strong>SNAP AR (Lens Studio 5.6.0):</strong> Snapchat’s AR creation tool for interactive effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Effect House (TikTok):</strong> Enables TikTok users to build custom AR experiences.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>IoT and AR Integration</h2>
        <p>AR is being used to visualize IoT-enabled home appliances before purchasing or installation. Users can see how smart home devices like security systems, lighting, and thermostats will look and function in their space.</p>
        
        <h2>Hands-On Activities</h2>
        <h3>A-Frame</h3>
        <p>A-Frame is an open-source web framework built on Three.js, designed to make AR and VR development accessible through HTML-like syntax. It is widely used for creating immersive experiences without requiring extensive programming knowledge.</p>
        <p><strong>Why A-Frame?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows users to create AR/VR scenes using simple HTML elements.</li>
            <li>Supports WebXR, making it compatible with both VR headsets and AR-enabled devices.</li>
            <li>Can be used with AR.js for developing marker-based and markerless AR applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What We Did:</strong> We used A-Frame to create basic AR environments and experimented with marker-based tracking.</p>
        
        <h3>Snap AR (Lens Studio)</h3>
        <p>Snap AR, powered by Lens Studio, is a powerful tool used to create AR filters (Lenses) for Snapchat. It enables creators to design interactive experiences with face tracking, body tracking, and world AR effects.</p>
        <p><strong>Why Lens Studio?</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enables developers and designers to create interactive filters and effects.</li>
            <li>Supports AI-powered facial recognition and 3D object placement.</li>
            <li>Provides real-time preview and debugging for better development workflow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>What We Did:</strong> We created a custom Leopard Face Filter using Lens Studio’s face tracking features.</p>
        
        <h3>Other Activities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Downloaded and explored Blender for 3D modeling.</li>
            <li>Created a Sketchfab account to browse and share 3D models.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>VR Technologies</h2>
        <p>VR immerses users in fully digital environments. The session covered different VR platforms and devices.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meta Quest 2 & 3:</strong> Standalone VR headsets by Meta, providing wireless VR experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>Meta Horizon:</strong> A VR social platform where users can interact in a virtual space.</li>
            <li><strong>SideQuest:</strong> A third-party tool that allows installing and streaming custom VR apps on Meta Quest.</li>
        </ul>
